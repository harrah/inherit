A basic compiler plugin to write out the inheritance graph for a code base.  It produces a graphviz file inherit.dot.  Process it with something like:

  dot -Tpng -Grankdir=BT -o inherit.png inherit.dot

To build with sbt (Requires loader 0.5 or higher to cross-build.  See http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/wiki/Setup for sbt setup):

  $ sbt "+update" "+publish-local"

This produces a compiler plugin in target/scala_<scala-version>.  Choose the one for the version of Scala you are using.

Alternatively, if you would like to use the plugin in a project you are building with sbt, make your project definition extend AutoCompilerPlugins and add inherit as a dependency:

class YourProject(info: ProjectInfo) extends DefaultProject(info) with AutoCompilerPlugins
{
  val inherit = compilerPlugin("inherit" %% "inherit" % "0.1.2")
}
